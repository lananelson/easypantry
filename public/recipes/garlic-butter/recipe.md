## Ingredients

- 1 pound garlic cloves, peeled (8 to 10 bulbs)
- 4 anchovy fillets
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- Dried Sicilian oregano, to taste
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. In a small pot, add half of the garlic cloves along with the anchovies and red pepper flakes. Cover generously with extra-virgin olive oil. Cook slowly over very low heat until the garlic is soft and fragrant but not browned, about 1 1/2 hours.

2. Thinly slice about 6 ounces of the remaining garlic cloves. Fry gently in extra-virgin olive oil until just golden. Set aside.

3. Grind the remaining garlic (about 2 ounces) into a smooth paste.

4. In a large bowl, combine the softened butter with the confit garlic, fried garlic, and garlic paste. Whip until evenly incorporated.

5. Season with dried Sicilian oregano, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
