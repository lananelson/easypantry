## Ingredients

- 200 g tondini (round) beans, dried
- For the sauté: 1 carrot, 1 stalk celery, 1 onion
- 1 tomato, chopped
- 200 g wholemeal pasta (shape of your choice)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 1 bay leaf (optional)

## Instructions

1. Leave the beans to soak in plenty of water for 3–4 hours, then drain.

2. Prepare the sauté: finely chop the carrot, celery, and onion. In a pot, warm a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat and gently cook the vegetables until softened. Add the chopped tomato and cook for a few minutes more.

3. Add the drained beans to the pot and pour in enough fresh water to cover them generously. If you like, add a bay leaf. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until the beans are tender, about 40 minutes, adding more water as needed to keep them submerged.

4. Shortly before the beans are fully cooked, add the wholemeal pasta directly to the pot. Adjust the amount of water so there is enough for the pasta to cook and to create the sauce consistency you prefer—add more water for a looser soup-like dish, or keep it lower for a thicker, saucier pasta.

5. Cook until the pasta is al dente and the beans are fully tender. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

6. Serve hot, with an extra drizzle of olive oil and a final grind of pepper if you like.

## Notes

- Cooking time for the beans can vary depending on their age; continue simmering until they are creamy inside.
- Adjust the water during cooking to reach your preferred balance between brothy pasta-and-beans and a thicker saucy dish.
