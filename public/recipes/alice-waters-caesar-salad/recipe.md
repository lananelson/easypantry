## Ingredients

- 3 ounces day-old bread, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (for croutons)
- Salt
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 2 garlic cloves, pounded to a puree (or put through a garlic press)
- 2 teaspoons chopped anchovies, about 2-3 fillets
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/4 cup olive oil (for dressing)
- 1/2 cup Parmesan, freshly grated
- 2 heads romaine lettuce, dark outer leaves removed

## Instructions

1. Make croutons.

2. Meanwhile, wash the lettuce well, tearing the larger leaves into bite-size pieces and leaving the small light interior leaves whole. Dry well in a salad spinner and chill until ready to serve.

3. In a small bowl, mix together the acids, garlic, anchovies, and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk in the olive oil very slowly to make an emulsion. Then whisk in the egg yolk and a handful of the Parmesan cheese (perhaps half). Taste for salt and acid with a piece of the lettuce.

4. In a large bowl, add the lettuce and pour over 3/4 of the dressing, tossing well, adding more dressing if needed. Add most of the remaining cheese, and arrange the salad in serving bowls or plates. Toss the croutons in the large bowl to soak up remaining dressing, and scatter them over the individual servings. Top with any remaining cheese and serve with a twist of black pepper.
