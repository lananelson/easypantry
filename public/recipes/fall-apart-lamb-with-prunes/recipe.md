## Ingredients

- 4 lamb shanks
- Kosher salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 1 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
- 2 cups low-sodium organic chicken broth
- 12 large cloves of garlic, unpeeled
- 20 pitted prunes
- Fresh mint and parsley to serve

## Instructions

1. Season the lamb liberally with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a high-sided sauté pan until it shimmers. Brown the meat on all sides.

2. Set the meat aside, and lower the heat to low. Carefully add the sliced onions, and sauté on very low heat for 20 minutes, until soft and lightly caramelized. Season the onions with salt and pepper.

3. Raise the heat to high. Deglaze the pan with the white wine, and cook off for 2 minutes. Add the stock, garlic, prunes, and lamb to the pan. Bring the broth to a boil, then lower the heat to low, and cook, covered, on the lowest heat for 2 hours.

4. Serve piping hot, with torn fresh leaves of parsley and mint over the top, with Dauphinoise or couscous on the side.
