## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried Rio Zape beans, rinsed (or substitute black or Anasazi beans)
- 5 dried chiles (for mild spiciness use 2 anchos and 3 negros; for a little more heat, substitute in some guajillos)
- 6 sun-dried tomato halves (not in oil)
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 3 tablespoons neutral oil such as grapeseed
- 5 cups water
- Sour cream, for serving
- Cilantro, for serving
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar (optional; see notes)

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet and toast the chiles about one minute on each side until they puff up and become fragrant. Also heat the garlic cloves until they start to blacken. Meanwhile remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and immerse them in 2 cups hot water, along with the sun-dried tomatoes. When the garlic cloves are done, peel them and put them in a blender. Toast the cumin and fennel seeds in the skillet for about one minute and add these to the blender, along with the cinnamon and cocoa powder. Spoon in the softened chiles and tomatoes. Add 1 cup of the soaking liquid, strained. Blend until you have a smooth paste.

2. Heat the oil in a pan and add the chile paste. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes until it has darkened in color and become very fragrant. Rinse the blender jar with the remaining soaking liquid and add to the pan. If using, transfer to your slow cooker. Add the beans and 3 more cups of water. Cook on high for 4 to 6 hours (the cooking time will depend on the dryness of the beans and the slow cooker model). When the beans are soft, add salt to taste. If cooking on the stovetop instead of a slow cooker, add additional water as needed and cook until the beans are tender.

3. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and sprigs of cilantro.

## Notes

- Original recipe by Fairmount_market on Food52. The beans are prepared with a toasted chile sauce that includes cinnamon and cocoa, giving them a mole-like character and a deep mahogany color.
- The original author suggests that about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar can be added towards the end of cooking for a touch of sweetness. This version lists brown sugar as an optional ingredient.
- The dish works well as a main with toppings and salads, or as a side for fish tacos, grilled chicken, or roasted pepper quesadillas.
