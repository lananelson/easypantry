## Ingredients

- 7 oz. extra firm tofu (about half of a standard-sized package — no need to drain and press for this recipe)
- 2 shallots, chopped
- about 1 T olive oil or some other cooking oil
- 1 small red bell pepper, chopped
- 4-5 button mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 1 cup packed fresh spinach leaves
- 1/4 cup lemon juice (the juice of about one lemon)
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 3 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp mustard powder
- pinch cayenne pepper (some red pepper flakes would also work here to add spice)
- 1/2 tsp salt (more or less to taste)
- 1 ripe avocado, sliced
- freshly ground pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a skillet on medium high heat.

2. Add shallots and stir, cooking for about three minutes, or until they begin to soften and brown.

3. Add red bell pepper and mushrooms; stir, cook for about 2 minutes more.

4. Add the spices (cumin, thyme, turmeric, mustard powder, cayenne) and stir very briefly, then splash some water into the pan.

5. Add in the tofu by crumbling it with your fingers. Stir well. Then add the spinach and stir some more.

6. Cook for about 7-10 minutes, stirring frequently and adding splashes of water if the tofu starts to dry out or stick. BUT: be careful not to add TOO much water — I've done this and it results in soggy, soupy tofu.

7. Stir in the lemon juice and nutritional yeast.

8. Serve immediately with avocado slices and freshly ground pepper.
