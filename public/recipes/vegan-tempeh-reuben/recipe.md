## Ingredients

- 2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil (for marinade)
- 2 Tbs. balsamic vinegar (for marinade)
- 2 Tbs. low-sodium, gluten-free tamari (for marinade)
- 1 Tbs. gluten-free, vegan Worcestershire sauce (for marinade)
- 2 Tbs. raw apple cider vinegar (for marinade)
- 2 Tbs. water (for marinade)
- 1 tsp. liquid smoke (for marinade)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (for marinade)
- 1 tsp. onion powder (for marinade)
- 1 tsp. dried mustard (for marinade)
- 1 tsp. dried coriander (for marinade)
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika (for marinade)
- 1 bay leaf, crumbled (for marinade)
- 1/3 cup vegan mayonnaise (for Russian dressing)
- 2 Tbs. ketchup (for Russian dressing)
- 1 Tbs. prepared horseradish (for Russian dressing)
- 1 tsp. gluten-free, vegan Worcestershire sauce (for Russian dressing)
- 1/8 tsp. hot sauce or Sriracha, optional (for Russian dressing)
- Kosher salt and black pepper to taste (for Russian dressing)
- 1 block tempeh, cut into 8 pieces
- 1 Tbs. canola oil
- 1-2 Tbs. vegan butter
- 4 slices gluten-free bread
- 1 cup sauerkraut
- 1 cup canola oil (for vegan mayo)
- 1/2 cup soy milk (for vegan mayo)
- 1 tsp fresh lemon juice (for vegan mayo)
- Pinch of salt (for vegan mayo)
- Pinch of ground mustard or 1/2 tsp prepared mustard (for vegan mayo)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients in a bowl or container. Cut the tempeh into 8 pieces. I do this by cutting the rectangular block in half so I have 2 squares. Then I slice each square like a bagel so that it's turned into 4 thin squares. Then cut each square in half so you have 8 thin rectangular pieces. Add the tempeh to the marinade, cover and let sit for at least one hour. Meanwhile, prepare the Russian dressing and refrigerate until ready to use.

2. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and grill the tempeh on both sides until browned and softened, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the grill pan and set aside.

3. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Coat one side of each slice of bread with vegan butter. Cook the bread, buttered side down, on the griddle until golden brown. Remove from the griddle but leave the griddle on the heat. Butter the uncooked side of the bread.

4. On the cooked side of one slice of bread, slather some of the Russian dressing. Add 4 pieces of tempeh and a good amount of sauerkraut. Slather the cooked side of a second piece of bread with Russian dressing and top the sandwich.

5. Put the sandwich onto the hot griddle, buttered side down. Press on the sandwich gently with a spatula and cook until the bottom is browned, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the sandwich over and brown the other buttered side. Repeat with the second sandwich. Serve while hot.

## Notes

- To make vegan mayo: blend all ingredients together (1 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup soy milk, 1 tsp fresh lemon juice, pinch of salt, pinch of ground mustard or 1/2 tsp prepared mustard)
